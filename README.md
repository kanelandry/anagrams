anagrams
========

Given a random text containing many character strings separated from each other by a comma, the code is able to find the anagrams of each string inside the input

Time complexity (worst and average cases): O (n+m) where n is the number of elements in the input array and m is the number of unique identifiers/indexes  of the anagram set.

Space complexity (worst and average cases): O (2m+1) where m is the number of unique identifiers/indexes  of the anagram set and 1 represent s the variable $pattern
